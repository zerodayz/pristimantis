# Advanced Troubleshooting

This is idea behind the Advanced Troubleshooting

# Enable Debug
Always check that debug is enabled in configuration file.

With crudini:

Note: You need to install package `crudini`

```
[root@undercloud-0 ~]# crudini --get  /etc/nova/nova.conf DEFAULT debug
True
```

With g/re/p:

```
[root@undercloud-0 ~]# egrep "^\[.*\]|^(debug|\#debug)" /etc/nova/nova.conf
[DEFAULT]
#debug=false
debug=True
[api_database]
[barbican]
[cache]
```
# Date
Always check date if the cluster is synced with NTP.
# Agent health
Check if any of the services/agents is reported as down

```
nova service-list
cinder service-list
neutron agent-list
heat service-list
```

Open configuration for the service which the agent/service shows as down.

```report_interval :``` status report interval, ie heartbeat interval, defaults to 10 seconds.

```service_down_time :``` the longest time from the last heartbeat,  if it takes more than this time to get a heartbeat, then the service is down, the default is 60 seconds.

Note: *```report_interval``` must be less than ```service_down_time```, otherwise you send a heartbeat each 60 seconds, and since agent is 30 seconds without heartbeat it will think that the service down, obviously the service will always be in the down state.*
## Possible root causes
1. Database access errors leads to heartbeat update failure, this situation can be seen from the error log.

2. RabbitMQ connection failure, nova-compute can not directly access the database, the update is done through the RPC call nova-conductor, if the RabbitMQ connection fails, RPC will not be able to perform, resulting in heartbeat transmission failure.

3. nova-conductor failure, the same reason, but this situation is very low probability, unless the someone closed the service.

4. Time is not synchronized. This is very difficult to check this situation, because you can not find any error message in the log.

# Horizon
When you are seeing `401 Unathorized` try opening the same in Chrome then

1. Click the three dots `...` on the right side on your browser.
2. Click `More tools`
3. Click on `Developer tools Ctrl+Shift+i`
4. Next reproduce the error and under `XHR` right click on the failed query.
5. Click on `Copy` -> `Copy as cURL`

This might give you insights what API is being called and you can reproduce from CLI.
# Reporting bugs
Check to see if your bug has already been filed.

Some bugs may have been encountered by others before you. You can search Launchpad to see if anyone has already run into your issue and whether a fix is already available. Most bugs that have a fix committed will also have a comment with a pointer to the patch that fixes the issue. You may also want to search upstream bug reports to see if the problem isn't specific to the RHOS.
